A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors â€“  nevenne
*   "Indexing , Seo, Google Indexing, plugin fix indexing, reindexing web site, fix noindex, google noindex fix, fix indexing wordpress plugin
*   "Tags Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on 6.0.3
*   "Donations PayPal : nevsak9@gmail.com
*   " Tested  6.0.1  work on higher versions.
*   Subversion 1.0.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
